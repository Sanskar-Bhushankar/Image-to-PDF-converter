# Image to PDF Converter

A powerful, privacy-focused web application that converts images to PDF files directly in your browser. Built with React and powered by client-side processing for maximum privacy and security.

Disclaimer - I made it for my personal use, to convert images to PDF files, and I thought it might be useful for others. As other apps have paid plans, I thought I should make this for free for myself and others.


## üåü Features

- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no server uploads required
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy drag-and-drop interface for image uploads
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple images at once
- **Image Reordering**: Drag and drop to reorder images before conversion
- **Two Conversion Modes**:
  - Full Page Mode: Each image takes up an entire PDF page
  - Canvas Mode: Images are fitted to A4 pages with margins
- **Custom PDF Naming**: Name your output PDF file
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Format Support**: Accepts JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF files
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression for optimal PDF file size
